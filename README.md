**Compilation Instructions**
In order to compile our primary code that we used for the final, it's actually quite simple. First, install python 2.7 onto your system and add it to the system path. Once that is done, you simply clone the respository on a raspberry pi (or really any unix system, you'll need git to clone it). Once that is done, navigate to python_programs/team3PyCode/ once you are there, simply type 'sudo python controlDrone.py'. Since the code is python, there is no need to actually 'compile' the code, instead you need to simply run it. You'll need some sort of audio device connected in order to see the code run.
